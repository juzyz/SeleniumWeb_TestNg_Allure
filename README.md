# SeleniumWeb_TestNg_Allure
This demo represents a simplified framework for testing a website using the Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Allure frameworks. The project includes examples:

1. Including different types of waiters (for the visibility or presence of an element) and asserts.
2. Passing data to DataProvider from an Excel Sheet in TestNG.
3. Executing TestNG test cases using a TestNG XML file and controlling the order of execution via attributes of the Test annotation.
4. Applying the Page Object Model pattern for the framework architecture.
